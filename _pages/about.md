## Class Information

This module provides the opportunity for students to apply the theoretical Big Data Science knowledge gained in the core part of this degree. The course involves a blend of lectures and practical group assignments.

Students are expected to identify and work with a collaborator who takes ownership of the project. This collaborator can be an industry partner or a researcher within one of the participating departments. Projects are based on the entire big data lifecycle, including data gathering, analysis, and a final technical report.

## Course Structure

The course is organized into four blocks that follow the data science lifecycle:

1. **Scoping and EDA** - Problem definition, project scoping, and exploratory data analysis
2. **Modelling** - Analytical modelling (descriptive, exploratory, inferential, predictive, causal, mechanistic) and evaluation
3. **Visualisation and Deployment** - Communicating insights and deploying solutions
4. **Putting It All Together** - Final project integration, model cards, and exhibition

## Outcomes

This module combines first-year modules of the MIT program into practice through a Data Science project. After successful completion of this module, students will be able to:

*   Break down the entire data science life cycle of a project
*   Work effectively with a project partner
*   Deliver a complete Data Science solution

## Instructors

The module has been taught by the following instructors since 2020:

*   **Prof. Vukosi Marivate:** Vukosi has a background in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence and is interested in the role of Data Science in Society.
*   **Dr. Abiodun Modupe:** Abiodun is interested in the confluence of artificial intelligence for natural language processing and speech recognition.
