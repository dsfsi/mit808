## Class Information

This module provides the opportunity to students for demonstrating the application of the theoretical Big Data Science knowledge gained in the core part of this degree. Students are expected to identify and work with a collaborator who is taking ownership for the project. This collaborator can either be an industry partner or a researcher within one of the participating departments. Projects will be based on the entire big data lifecycle as discussed in this degree programme. This includes the gathering of data of a significant size as well as a final technical report describing the process followed and the deliverables.

## Outcomes

This module combines 1st year modules of the MIT C program into practice through a Data Science project. After successful completion of this module, the student will:

* Able to break down the entire data science life cycle of a project
* Work with a project partner
* Deliver a Data Science solution
